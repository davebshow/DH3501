      "They've already got their data stored in some **huge** csv files, but they need you to model it as a property graph and get it imported into Neo4j graph database. If you are really into Gremlin with the Titan backend, they may consider that as an alternative to Neo4j, but you'd really have to know what you are doing. If you botch it, that job is history!\n",

Furthermore, all pre-processing (presumably performed in Python) should be written in concise idomatic style, and produce data structures that conform the student's data model. Finally, the resulting database must conform to the declared data model.\n",
