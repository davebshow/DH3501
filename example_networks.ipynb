    "This study presents a network approach to understanding why certain ingredients are combined with others. Using a bipartite network of ingredients and their respective flavour compounds, they determine which ingredients had a similar flavor profile, and then analyze how they are combined in recipes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there quantifiable and reproducible principles behind our choices to combine some flavors and avoid combining others?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do we tend to combine foods that have similar flavor profiles?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A bipartite network was built using 381 popular ingredients and their flavor compounds. This was then projected over the flavor compounds as a one mode network of ingredient. Then they created an ingredient network using recipes as a proxy for ingredient relationships using data from epicurious.com, allrecipes.com, and menupan.com in order to determine if ingredients that shared flavor compounds indeed were paired in recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "They determined that certain groups of food, such as fruits and dairy with alcohol, tend to be closely associated by flavor networks. Other groups, like mushrooms are more isolated. In terms of pairing, they see that North American and Western European foods tend to combine ingredients that share flavor compounds, while East Asian and Southern European recipes combine ingredients that do not. However, both of these phenomenon are due to several important ingredients that are highly common in each respective type of cuisine."

    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis produced several interesting results regarding the effects of geography and genre in the network, as well as the importance of cross role collaboration. We demonstrated how individuals were generally limited by geographic factors, and that many individuals had begun to specialize in terms of publication. Furthermore, we see the importance of collaboration between individuals performing different roles with tendencies toward disassortative mixing, which suggests that interactions between high and low profile individuals were essential for this community to operate."

Cities like New York change over time, at certain times a birth attractor, at others, a death attractor."
