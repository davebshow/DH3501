    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do aspects such as geography and genre affect the relationships between the individuals involved in the production of this literature?\n",

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A large sample of scanned copies of the preliminaries sections were acquired through interlibrary loans. After manual review, the data contained within was modeled as a multipartite network. Based on this network, we performed a series of transformations that allowed us to perform network analysis with particular attention to the effects of attribute homophily and assortativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis produced serveral interesting results regaring the effects of geography and genre in the network, as well as the importance of cross role collaboration. We demonstrated how individuals were generally limited by geographic factors, and that many individuals had begun to specialize in terms of publication. Futhermore, we see the importance of collaboration between individuals performing differnt roles with tendencies toward disassortative mixing, which suggests that interactions between high and low profile individiuals were essential for this communitiy to operate."

While certain cities, such as Paris, hold long term dominance as attractor cities, there is competition between a variety of mid sized cities for second tier dominance as attractors. Cities like New York change over time, at certain times a birth attractor, at others, a death attractor."
