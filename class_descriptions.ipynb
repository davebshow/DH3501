It begins with simple aspects of notation, basic set operations like union, intersection, and membership, and reading set builder notation. After we translate these kinds of expressions to Python, we look at how Jackson has employed set builder notation to describe concepts from graphs in his book. This notation is then applied in a varity of contexts from describing node neighborhoods to statistical algorithms for calculating network centrality.\n",

    "This class begins with a discussion of Mark Granovetters famous 1973 study, and its importance for our understanding of the way information is transmitted accross a network. Then, we take a step-by-step approach to understanding the theoretical models associated with some of the concept introduced in the study. Beginning with an introduction to the dynamic process of triadic closure, we analyze how triangle form in a graph to produce clusters, and how this process intereacts with the concept of strength of ties, and local bridges. We then see how these rough models have been fine tuned into the more subtle model provided by Onnela's study of cell phone communication, the concept of neighborhood overlap, and how this functions as an extension of the previous concepts. We also examine how different proxies for edge strength have been applied in studies of Facebook, and make an intuitive evaluation of the efficacy of this technique. Finally, we contextualize the concepts of closure, bridges, and structural holes by providing real world examples of how these structural properties provide social capital in real world situations.\n",

    "This class introduces the concept of network context through an exploration of the concept of homophily. By presenting homophily as a motivation for network dynamics (link formation), this class emphasizes the distinction of intristic vs. contextual factors in network processes. We then dichotomize the concept of homophily into status and value homophily, looking at how immutable (or status) characteristics affect network formation (as in Moody 2001), and contrasting this with homophily based mutable characteristics, such as political affiliation. With respect to mutable characteristics, we investigate the process of social influences such as peer pressure in order to evaluate the (marginally) competing theories of homophily and socialization. This class also introduces the concept of the affiliation, or multi-partite network, along with a discussion of the basic analytic techniques used with this kind of network. We see how these techniques have been implemented in NetworkX, and then we consider an alternative implementation of multi-partite analysis using projx, a Python library that wraps NetworkX to provide a domain specific language (DSL) for performing multi-partite transformations and compressions. Note: projx was implemented by yours truly, and while it hasn't seen really heavy adoption, it averages about 30-50 downloads a day. However, it is important to understand that I don't introduce this tool to promote its use, but instead to provide a conceptual excercise for the students to think about multi-partite graph transformations.\n",

We then discuss alternative solutions for data modeling and storage focusing on the big data revolution and the advent of NoSQL databases.
